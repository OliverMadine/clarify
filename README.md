# Clarify - Making the web accessible for everyone

Clarify was a five-week "Designing for Real People" second-year group project at Imperial College London, Department of Computing.

We designed a Chrome extension to **enhance web surfing** for **people with dyslexia**, allowing them to:
- customise the appearance of web pages
- save their favourite configurations
- share their configurations with the community

We also created a [web app](https://clarify-this.herokuapp.com) that allows users to:
- demo the Chrome extension
- download popular user configurations to their Chrome extension
