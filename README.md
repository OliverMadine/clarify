# Clarify - Making the web accessible for everyone

This project was created for the DRP 2nd year group project at Imperial College London, Computing department.

We designed a Chrome extension to **enhance web surfing** for **dyslexic people**, allowing them to:
- customise the appearance of the web pages,
- save favourite configurations and
- share them with the community.

We also created a [web app](https://clarify-this.herokuapp.com) that offers a **demo** of the Chrome extension and shows the most popular configurations.
